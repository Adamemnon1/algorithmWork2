These files have my work on creting a working efficient HashTable in Java, wihtout using the
default HashTable class. 
This HashTable is used for storing DNA sequence information.

Record.java - the object that holds the a string section of DNA.

SeqReader.java - the object used to read in the DNA information.

StringTable.java - This class has the hashtable construction algorithm. It ensures the hashTable is 
  never filled and every Record is stored uniquely.
  This is where most of my work is.
