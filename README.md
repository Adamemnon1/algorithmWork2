These files have my work on creting a working efficient HashTable in Java, wihtout using the
default HashTable class. 
This HashTable is used for storing DNA sequence information.

Record.java - the object that holds the a string section of DNA.

SeqReader.java - the object used to read in the DNA information.

StringTable.java - This class has the hashtable construction algorithm. It ensures the hashTable is 
  never filled and every Record is stored uniquely.
  This is where most of my work is. 

This repository consists of large sections of code provided to me, and then I wrote the code that implements the actual algorithm.
